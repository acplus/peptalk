0.7 10.0 7.0
1AWR	 cl1/4 (+cl4 a little; cl1 a little larger than pepsite)
1CKA	 cl1/6 (+cl3 a little)
1CZY	 cl1/4 (no full overlap) 
1D4T	 cl2/5 (+cl1 a little; not all peptide caught) Looks difficult to improve - maybe score?
1DDV	 cl0/5 (failure: small protein; pp peptide)
1DKX	 cl1/3 (hole in protein.... looks nice!)
1EG4	 cl3+4/4 (extended peptide, two knobs-to hole found; not all of pepesite identified: maybe lower cutoff will help?)
1ER8	 cl1/2
1GYB	 cl0/4	(failure: cl1 looks really good - maybe add site?)
1HC9	 cl1/2	(good; small protein)
1IHJ	 cl1/3	(good; not whole sight caught)
1JD5	 cl1/6	(small overlap only; maybe cutoff?)
1JWG	 cl1+3/3 (partial overlap only)
1LVM	 2 peptides: cl1/3; cl3/3 (second only partial overlap)
1MFG	 cl1+4/4 (partial overlap only: cutoff?)
1N7F	 cl1+2/4
1NQ7	 cl1/1	(large single cluster: covers more than peptide; large protein)
1NTV	 cl1/2	(partially no overlap; large protein)
1NVR	 cl3/8	(partial overlap only: small clusters)
1NX1	 cl3/3	(partial overlap: peptide is longer; 1+2 are in loosely packed region - maybe add. site?)
1OAI	 cl1/1	(small protein; large cluster that covers substantial part of protein)
1QKZ	 cl0/2	failure: cl1+2 between two domains; peptide at end of domain. Maybe cutoff?
1RXZ	 cl1/4	(partial overlap only)
1SE0	 cl2/2	very partial overlap only: was alignment done right between bound and unbound?
1SFI	 cl1/2	cluster reaches other side - should be prevented.
1SSH	 cl1+3/3 (small protein: clusters cover almost all of surface)
1T4F	 cl1/3 	(large cluster, covers more than peptide; much of the surface)
1T7R	 cl1+2	(middle of peptide not cauhgt: cutoff?)
1TP5	 cl1/1	(small protein; sign part of surface covered)
1TW6	 cl1+4/5
1U00	 cl1/4	(hole - looks similar to the one with hole above)
1UJ0	 cl2+3/4      (not clear why cl2+3 are not merged; cl1 very large; goes through protein. should be fixed somehow)
1W9E	 cl1+2/5
1X2R	 cl1/2	(very small clusters; large protein: could less stringent score cutoff make them larger?
1YMT	 cl1+3/4      (not clear why not merged; not all peptide caught)
1YWO	 cl1+2/3      (polypro!!; clusters cover much of surface)
2A3I	 cl1,5,6/6    (merging could be improved)
2AK5	 cl1/4
2B9H	 cl1,3,5/8	(small clusters, dispersed: could score cutoff help connect?)
2C3I	 cl1+5/5
2CCH	 cl1/3	(beautifull!)
2D0N	 cl1+2/4	(mostly cl2; clusters cover most of surface)
2DS8	 cl2/2		(almost all is colored; very small protein)
2FMF	 cl1/4
2FOJ	 cl2+4/4	(could be merged?)
2FVJ	 cl1+2/3
2H9M	 cl2+3/3	(barrel: cl1 is another binding site! look in cartoon mode)
2HO2	 cl1/4
2HPL	 cl1/1
2J6F	 cl1+4/4
2JAM	 cl3/5	(only partial overlap)
2O02	 cl1+2+3/4
2O4J	 cl1+3/3
2O9V	 cl0/3	(failure; poly-pro)
2P0W	 cl1+4/6
2P54	 cl1+4/5
2PUY	 cl1/3	(only partial:peptide longer)
2VJ0	 two peptides cl1+2(mostly 2)/6; missed
2ZJD	 cl1+4/4
3CVP	 cl1+4/4
3D1E	 cl1+2/7
3D9T	 cl0/6	(complete failure: is the superposition ok?)
